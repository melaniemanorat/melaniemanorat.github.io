			<u><strong>First Website</strong></u>
			<p>
				The assignment was to create a website to display our bio, including a pic of ourselves, and portfolio.
				We needed to make sure the links were unbreakable, easy to navigate, and we had at least three css edits.
				We then, were required to put our revised scratch project on the site.
